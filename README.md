**<b>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?</b>**

<b> The project was to train an AI so that it could complete the pirate treasure game. The objective was to get the agent to find the path to the end using the fastest route. The code that was given to us was defining the
game map and if the game was won or not. The part that I was suppose to code was the algorigthm for the AI. The model was also provided for us. In this we use Q-training and I completed the pseudocode that was given for the Agent. </b>

**<b>Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:</b>**
<b>To connect this with the computer science field we can look at how companies are trending toward the use of AI. AI has been around for some time now, however it hasn't been use like it is today. Computer scientist can use 
this type of machine learning to redefine how applicaitons are created and used.</b>

**<b>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? </b>**
<b>Computer scientist are simply problem solvers. They take a problem and figure out how to translate that into something a computer or application can help solve that problem. This matters because without computer scientist we
would not have nearly all the current technology that we have today. It took years of trial and error creating different algorithms for different uses that are still used today. </b>

**<b>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? </b>**
<b>There are multiple ways to approach a problem. Depending on the problem it may require breaking the problem down into smaller portion. This is known as taking a dynamic approach or dynamic programming. </b>

**<b>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</b>**
<b>As a programmer my responsibilities is to create applications that keep the end user in mind. I wouldn't want their data or personal information to become compromised. We also shouldn't create software if we know that it could petential harm someone or group of people.   </b>
